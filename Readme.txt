Map - I think this is the latest source for the Mobile London Street Map midlet.

MapMaker - This was a Qt program I was working on (actually basically finished) that lets you easily convert an image file into a midlet that is like the Tube Map midlet. tube_index_done.txt is for this.

MapTemplate - This is the template midlet for MapMaker. Basically MapMaker takes this midlet, and adds the map tiles and index file into the .jar.

Metro Maps - Some PDFs and images that I was going to turn into midlets, but never did - it would be great if you could!

TubeMaps - This is the old source code for when I created all the Tube and Bus map midlets separately, instead of using MapMaker.

MapsIndexer, MapWriter, OSMParser - I used these somehow to make the .mapth files. Somehow. Street Map Readme.txt has old instructions. I was working on an ATM layer but never finished that. Also I think the streetmap.co.uk website has changed so you'll have to rewrite the thing that downloads all the tiles.

StreetmapCreator - This was an unfinished Qt program I was working on that would let you select an area of the UK, and then download streetmap.co.uk tiles and turn then into a .mapth file.
